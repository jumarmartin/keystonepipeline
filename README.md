# KeystonePipeline
A small program to be used as my AP Computer Science Principles program submission that tests for comprehension and developmental capacity. 

Named after the Keystone Pipeline fiasco of 2016.

This program actually calculates your Body Mass Index. I hope it is complex enough for the AP CompSci P judges to score high marks.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository
- run ```go build main.go``` in the repository directory
- finally, run ```./main``` in the repository directory to run the program.
